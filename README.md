## How To Use

1. Install and start the copilot-gpt4-service, e.g., after local startup, the API default address is: `http://127.0.0.1:8080`;
2. Get your GitHub account Github Copilot Plugin Token (see below for details);
3. Install a third-party client, e.g., [ChatGPT-Next-Web](https://github.com/ChatGPTNextWeb/ChatGPT-Next-Web), and fill in the settings with the API address of copilot-gpt4-service and the Github Copilot Plugin Token in the settings, and you can use the GPT-4 model to have a conversation.

## Deployment Methods

### Best Practice Approach

As verified and discussed by the community, the best practice approach is.

1. Local deployment for personal use only (Recommend);
2. Deploy with your own server integration [ChatGPT-Next-Web](https://github.com/ChatGPTNextWeb/ChatGPT-Next-Web), the service is not public;
3. server deployment, public but for personal use (e.g. multi-client scenarios [Chatbox](https://github.com/Bin-Huang/chatbox), [OpenCat APP](https://opencat.app/), [ChatX APP](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chatx-ai-chat-client/id6446304087)).

### Not Recommended Approaches

1. Providing an interface as a public service

    Making multiple token requests from the same IP address can be flagged as abnormal behavior.
2. Offering public services using the same client web interface (e.g., ChatGPT-Next-Web) with the default API and API Key

   Making too many requests with the same token can be flagged as abnormal behavior.
3. Deploying with serverless providers

   Serverless providers have short service lifecycles and frequently change IP addresses, which can be flagged as abnormal behavior.
4. Other abusive behaviors or profiteering behaviors.

**⚠️ Very important: The above not recommended methods may cause Github Copilot to be banned, and it may not be possible to unban after being banned.**

```env
HOST=localhost # Service listening address
PORT=8080 # Service listening port
CACHE=true # Whether to enable persistence
CACHE_PATH=db/cache.sqlite3 # Path to persistent cache (only used when CACHE=true)
DEBUG=false # Whether to enable debug mode, more logs will be output when enabled
LOGGING=true # Whether to enable logging
LOG_LEVEL=info # Log level, optional values: panic, fatal, error, warn, info, debug, trace (Note: Only effective when LOGGING=true)
```

git clone https://github.com/aaamoon/copilot-gpt4-service && cd copilot-gpt4-service
# Modify the port in docker-compose.yml if necessary
docker compose up -d
```

To update the container, pull the code again and rebuild the image in the source code folder using the following command:

```bash
git pull && docker compose up -d --build
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

Supports deployment through Kubernetes, the specific deployment method is as follows:

```bash
helm repo add aaamoon https://charts.kii.la && helm repo update # Source by github pages
helm install copilot-gpt4-service aaamoon/copilot-gpt4-service
```

## Installation with ChatGPT-Next-Web

```bash
helm install copilot-gpt4-service aaamoon/copilot-gpt4-service \
  --set chatgpt-next-web.enabled=true \
  --set chatgpt-next-web.config.OPENAI_API_KEY=[ your openai api key ] \   #Token obtained by copilot
  --set chatgpt-next-web.config.CODE=[ backend access code ] \    # Access password for next chatgpt web ui
  --set chatgpt-next-web.service.type=NodePort \
  --set chatgpt-next-web.service.nodePort=30080
```

## Obtaining Copilot Token

Your account needs to have Github Copilot service enabled.

There are currently two ways to obtain the Github Copilot Plugin Token:

1. Obtain it by installing [Github Copilot CLI](https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-cli/) and authorizing (recommended).
2. Authorized access through a third-party interface, not recommended because it is not secure.

### Obtaining Through Github Copilot CLI

**For Linux/MacOS Platforms**

```bash
# The script below will automatically install Github Copilot CLI and obtain the Github Copilot Plugin Token through authorization
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaamoon/copilot-gpt4-service/master/shells/get_copilot_token.sh)"
```

**For Windows Platform**

Download the batch script and double-click to run it: [get_copilot_token.bat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaamoon/copilot-gpt4-service/master/shells/get_copilot_token.bat).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Model Support

According to the test, the model parameters support GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo, and the actual test will be processed at the default 3.5 when using other models (compared with the return results of the OpenAI API, guess it should be the earliest versions of GPT-4-0314 and GPT-3.5-turbo-0301)

### How To Determine If It's The GPT-4 Model

Why weren't I invited when my parents got married?

- GPT-3.5 They considered you too young at that time, so they didn't invite you.
- GPT-4 They got married before you were born.
